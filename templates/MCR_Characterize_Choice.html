<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>Choose the characterization method from the options below.</p>
	<p><strong>NOTE: Images must be binarized</strong></p>
	
	<p> <strong> Correlation Functions :</strong> They are statistical descriptors that quantitatively connect the macroscopic properties of a heterogeneous image to its complex microstructure. 
	Mathematically, they quantify the conditional probability of finding two randomly chosen points in the same phase (autocorrelation). Currently, our webtool can evaluate four widely used two-point 
	correlation functions - autocorrelation, lineal path, cluster and surface correlation.</p>

	<p> <strong> Physical Descriptors :</strong> Physical descriptors (aka features/predictors) provide a meaningful and convenient approach for direct elucidation of Processing-Structure-Property relations. 
	Descriptors are important structural parameters that are highly related to material properties and provide a reduced dimension representation of microstructure. Extracting descriptors from a microstructure 
	image involves application of image segmentation techniques to identify clusters of filler material followed by analysis of individual cluster. Although one can consider several descriptors, our webtool 
	evalautes four descriptors - volume fraction, number of white phase aggregates, aspect ratio and nearest neighbor distance. This method is best suited for materials with particulate filler clusters that are speherical/ellipsoidal in shape.</p>

	</div>
	<p> <strong> Spectral Density Function :</strong> The Spectral Density Function (SDF) is a frequency domain microstructure representation where different frequencies represent real 
	space features at different length scales. SDF provides a low-dimensional microstructure representation for quasi-random materials which have arbitrary filler geometry but its distribution is governed by an 
	underlying spatial correlation. The inverse Fourier Transform of SDF is the two-point autocorrelation function.</p>
