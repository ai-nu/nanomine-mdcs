	<p> Depending on the type of input, the results available for download vary:
    <p>

    <p><strong>1) Single image - </strong>Results will have the input images and a folder "Reconstruction" containing reconstructed images (in .jpg format) and a plot of correlation functions for both images for comparison.
		Plotted data is also provided in CSV files, with the first colomn and second colomn representing input (aka target image) and reconstructed images respectively.</p>
    <p><strong>2) Single image in .mat format - </strong>Results will have the input images and a folder "Reconstruction" containing reconstructed images (in .jpg format) and a plot of correlation functions for both images for comparison.
		Plotted data is also provided in CSV files, with the first colomn and second colomn representing input (aka target image) and reconstructed images respectively.</p>
    <p><strong>3) Multiple images in ZIP file</strong> - Results will contain input images renamed in the order they were processed (Input1, Input 2 ..) and three folders - 
		one containing the images obtained from ZIP file, one containing the characterization results and another containing reconstruction results.
		The characterization folder includes a plot of the correlation function (chosen for reconstruction) for all images in the ZIP file. 
		Plotted data is available in CSV file; the colomns represent images arranged in the order they were processed and the last colomn being the mean of all images.
		The mean of selected correlation is used for reconstruction. 
		The reconstruction folder contains reconstructed images (in .jpg) and CSV files of correlation functions (first colomn is the mean of input images followed by reconstructed images).
